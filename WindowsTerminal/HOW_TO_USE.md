## How to use this settings?
- Open your Windows Terminal default `settings.json`.
- (Optional) Remove all defaults actions in that JSON if you don't want to use those stupid Windows hotkeys.
- (Optional) If you have better hotkeys, you may want to remove all my actions before merge.
- Use this [tool](https://paji-toolset.net/json-merger) to merge 2 JSON together.
    - Put your JSON into the box above.
    - Put my JSON into the box below.
